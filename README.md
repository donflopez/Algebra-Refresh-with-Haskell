### Linear Algebra Refreshment with Haskell

I've decided to learn Haskell with a smooth start and at the same time make a refreshment of my algebra knowledge.

I'm starting this technique for learning a new language also learning or improving other knowledge (win-win). Learning Haskell with Algebra makes it better to start making simple functions like vector additions etc...

This is entirely work in progress, I've had some problems adding some packages (like diagrams) to Jupyter for drawing graphics with Haskell and make beautiful vector examples. I'm still trying, but I'm continuing with it without being blocked by that, so in the future, it'll have fantastic vector examples.

Please feel free to collaborate with any kind of improvement.
